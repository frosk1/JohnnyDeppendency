# Johnny Dependency
This Project contains a lightweight and fast dependency parser,
which benefits from a stream processing architecture. Johnny
Dependency implements transition based parser **arc-standard**
and **arc-eager** on a pure c++11 code base. A **standard-perceptron**
is used as statistical model.

### Getting Started
Clone this repository and follow the next steps for deployment.
*Generated binaries for different Linux Kernel and Windows will follow.

#### Requirements
- CMake 3.7...
- C++11 compiler (Visual C++, GCC, ... )
